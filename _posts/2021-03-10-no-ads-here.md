For giggles, I applied for [Google Adsense](http://google.com/adsense) and I guess my site doesn't have enough content yet so I wasn't 'ready for ads' yet. So...screw it. I won't bother with adsense for this site. I may link to the odd thing at Amazon but that's it.

Speaking of shopping on Amazon, I got new shoes in the mail today:

They are [Diadora Flamingo](https://amzn.to/3t29qNk) and they are great. They are only about $25.00 too. I'm hard on shoes and so these are cheap enough that I'm okay with the fact that they only last me a month or so.
