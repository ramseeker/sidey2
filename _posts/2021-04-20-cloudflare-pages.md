Just a short post about using [cloudflare pages](http://pages.cloudflare.com) a try for hosting this site vs my previous host which was [firebase](http://google.com/firebase) - another excellent choice.

To be honest, I don't really see much of a difference between the two execpt for the fact that cloudflare optimizes the images so that's a big help in reducing the page speed times.

Also, this is just fun to try different hosting plans and see what one suits me. I will give the cloudflare pages a bit of time before I fully commit but for now it's easy to work with.
