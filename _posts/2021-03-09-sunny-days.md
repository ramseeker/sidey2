A pretty nice day today with some sunshine and a few buds on the trees. It was warm enough today for me to get the cars rinsed off at least. They need a good detail still but at least you can see out of them.

Also, I am listing to [Bad Vaction by Liza Anne](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=JZjtRQA9rU8&feature=share) and so far so good. I have never heard of her before so it's nice to find a new artist to listen to.
