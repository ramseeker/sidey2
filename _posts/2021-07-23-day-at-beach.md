I am **for sure** not the first person to write "hey, it's been a while since I have posted..
so I won't even try to explain. 

But I thought I would take the time to share that [Jottacloud](http://www.jottacloud.com)might 
just be my favorite cloud backup service to date and one reason for this is that they 
offer a CLI version that lets me back up this entire site via a command line in the terminal. 
so now I know that this exciting post and all others were backed up in the cloud.
