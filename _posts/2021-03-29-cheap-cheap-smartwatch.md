It was my birthday **again** last week and I was gifted an Amazon gift card and on a whim I bought [this watch](https://amzn.to/2PaNZeY) for about $15.00, so as can be exepected I did not have high hopes. But, I was pleasantly surpised and it alerts me of my notifications and calls as well as count steps.

A pretty good deal for $15.00
