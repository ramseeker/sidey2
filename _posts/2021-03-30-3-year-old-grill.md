It's the last season for our 3 year old grill. You see, we always just buy the [cheapo grills](https://amzn.to/3ub3Rgm) because [pricier](https://amzn.to/39qcprp) options and boy is our 3 year old showing her age. It's held together with some extra screws I found and a whole lot of hope.

This grill has to get us through just **one more season**
