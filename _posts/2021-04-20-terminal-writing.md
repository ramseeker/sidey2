There was a time when I had to have 'distraction free' text editors to ge some writing done and I have found that all I really need is a terminal.

In fact it's **easier** to write in vim than any other text editor to date. It does take some time to get used to to but it's a pretty easy way to write and edit text.

The best part about writing in plain text is that you can pretty much start with any editor and then finish up with another if you choose.

I really don't mind this all that much I guess. It's not all that bad. I really [like](apple.com) this i guess, but i wonder if it would be any easier?![](/assets/pxl_20220425_184710353.jpg)
