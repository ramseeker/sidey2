My father passed away last week. Lukemia. He was 82. 

He left me with a **lot** of diecast cars to liquidate. I could have just called a dealer and taken whatever price he offered but I thought it would not be right just to liquidate what was a lifelong hobby. 

So, I'm selling them all. This actually isn't as bad as it sounds as I actually **enjoy** getting rid of them and it's not a burden at all. I have fun photographing them and touching and cleaning and learning about them so I figurerather than just sell them I might post them on here too as I go along. Like all my other little projects I'm not sure if I have the time to stick to it but I would like to try 

The photo you see is a 1953 Studebaker Starliner Coupe in a lovely burgandy color. This particular model is pretty detailed. It's got doors that open and a hood too and the underside is pretty well detailed as well. I guess if you can't afford the car you can at least get a small version of it.
