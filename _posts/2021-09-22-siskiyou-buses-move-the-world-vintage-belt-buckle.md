Title: Siskiyou Buses Move the World Vintage Belt Buckle
layout: post
---
This sold for $1.31..which is okay I guess. Others have listings asking for more [Check eBay](https://ebay.us/iWMbe7) for prices.


I'm not much of a belt buckle guy but this looks like it's a good weight and it has a blue sky and not one but **three** buses on it. What more could a bus-lover ask for? This sold buck for a buck. I thought I might get more than that for this for a 1989 belt buckle but so it goes.
