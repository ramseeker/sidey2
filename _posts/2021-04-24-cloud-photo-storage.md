I have been a little obsessive lately about backups. Specifically, my photos like the one you see above of my little one as I do not [want to lose them](https://jim.am/backup-your-photos/) due to some cloud failure. 

I had thought about storing them locally, but I really don’t have the time to fiddle with hard drives and backup software and RAID settgings so all the hard drives will go on eBay and I will go **all in on the cloud**  as there are apps for every cloud server that will **backup my photos automatically.** 

I’ve gone a little overboard as I have my photos backed up on [Google Photos](http://photos.google.com), [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com), [Amazon Photos](http://photos.amazon.com), [MEGA](http://mega.nz), [OneDrive](http://onedrive.com) and [pCloud](http://pcloud.com) and [IceDrive](http://icedrive.net). I defintely don’t need all these but except for pCloud and Google Drive all the others are free when it comes to storage. I had tried [Deego](http://deego.com) but it  looks to spammy for my liking with ads and app downloads all over. 

I had thought about setting up a NAS using a raspberry pi or [even just buying one](https://amzn.to/2SALgsv), but I don’t have time or inclination to do that any more. 

I’ve also realized that I really don’t need my camera gear I have as my **phone is good enough.** In fact I have yet to take a photo of my daughter with anything but my phone as they are that good in 2019. 

In 2037 when she’s 18 and I have thousands and thousands of photos I want to be sure I can get to them all and the cloud seems to be the easiest and safest way. 

I guess we will see.
