We loathed to spend the money but we were sick of buying [$79.00 Umbrellas](https://amzn.to/2RlHOFZ) where we
would only get a year - maybe two out of before they broke and were worthless. 

This we we decided to go big. **real big** and we splashed out for an 11 foot cantilever
umbrella from [lowes](http://www.lowes.com) that showed up today. 

It's a big sucker. The box was **88lbs of umbrella**. And of course there were problems 
and it took me a good part of the day to get the thing up. 

- Problem number 1

The first issue was when I opened the box I realized I needed 250lbs of [play sand](https://amzn.to/3hwx1TY) that
was not included in the purchase. And boy, what a mess. The base is 4 hollow compartments
where you have to add some sand, then some water, then some sand...rinse and repeat

You try juggling a little plastic container with one hand and a 50lb bag of sand with the other and see how you do. 
I had sand **everywhere**. 

Most of my day was spent cleaning up the sand and even after cleaning up I still feel like there's sand everywhere. 

- Problem number 2

The 2nd problem was placment. I got the thing assembled and the realized that where I *thought* would 
be able to place it won't work. The deck was 12 feet and this is 11 feet. But, with the base it's really about a 14 foot span. 

One more thing I didn't realize until it was much too late. So, I had to disassemble the entire thing and re-place it to another spot and 
now I think I might have to **put it back where it was** because it's more versatile there for protecting us from the sun for the entire day. 

- Problem number 3

Due to the sand, and the fact that it's 88lbs of stuff to return, plus another 200 pounds of sand filled patio base means that well -- we are keeping it. 
I highly doubt I would see a refund for this. We've bought this. 

I may have to spend some time taking this thing apart a few more times so we get the best sun protection on our back deck which seems to 
**always get sun** it's been a good purchase and hopefully we will be able to spend a nice summer outside without cooking to death.
