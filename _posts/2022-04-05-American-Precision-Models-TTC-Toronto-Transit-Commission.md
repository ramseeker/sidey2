I almost didn't bother listing this as there's no markings on the bottom except for the obligatory **made in China** and three letters on the bottom: APM

ON a whim, I found some info on this and thought I doubt it sells for much I might see a few bucks from it



<div class="image-gallery">
  {% for image in site.static_files %}
    {% if image.path contains '/assets/APMTTC' %}
     <a href="{{image.path}}">  <img src="{{ image.path  | resize: "800x800" }}"></a>

    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
