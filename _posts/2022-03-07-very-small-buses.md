title: Four Very Tiny Buses
layout: post
---

I sold these for $5.00 because I agreed to an offer.  [Check eBay](https://ebay.us/bLN25E) for prices.

If I had to guess, these very tiny plastic buses are for model railroads, but I really have no idea. These were my Dad's, like all the other cars I have posted about here so far and so I have no idea of the history of these.

All I know is that they are pretty small. I have no idea what these were worth so I sold them for five bucks.
